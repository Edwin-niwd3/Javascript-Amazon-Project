To run this program, no special necessities are required. Simply ensure that all files are downloaded and in the proper folder, ad the program should run just fine.

In the "amazon" page, you can select any quantity of items, from 1 - 10, through the dropdown menu, and send them directly to your cart.

In the "checkout" page, you can update the amount of items you have in your art, setting it to any number. You can also set different delivery types, either 7 days, 3 days or 1 day. Should you choose not to want a specific product you can also delete the product from your cart, with the delete button.
All of these factors affect the payment section, changing how much is you owe.

Once you press checkout you will be taken to the orders section. As it currently stands I only have the orders be automatically shown on the page, in their own seperate sections. None of the buttons currently work.
